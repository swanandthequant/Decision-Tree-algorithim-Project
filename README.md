# Decision Tree Project  

This project applies **Decision Trees** for both classification and regression problems.  
The goal was to understand how decision trees are constructed and how they can be tuned for better performance.  

---

## Dataset  
- For **Classification**: Imported the **Iris dataset** using `sklearn.datasets`.  
- For **Regression**: Imported the **Diabetes dataset** from the same library.  

---

## Methodology  
1. Model Training (the data camed clean, so no preprocessing needed).  
2. Hyperparameter Tuning (using Grid Search CV and Randamized Search CV).  
3. Model Evaluation with:  
   - accuracy_score  
   - confusion_matrix  
   - classification_report

## What I Learned  
- How Decision Trees are made and derived step by step.  
- How to train models usinfg Decision Tree algorithm.  
- The importance of tuning depth and other parameters to avoid overfitting.
